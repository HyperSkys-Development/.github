# Hello, we're HyperSkys Development ðŸ‘‹

### Who are we? ðŸ¤”

We are a group of developers working on Minecraft Networks, Java Projects, and much more and hoping to expand and make a major impact on the development scene. We've founded several successful ideas and turned them into reality with our team.

### Our Current Projects ðŸ“’

- hBungee - A custom Waterfall fork which allows you to customize most of waterfalls internals.
- hCore - A core management plugin for any server, has many cool features that even paid cores do not have.
- We have many more projects but most are private, sorry.

### Get in Contact ðŸ¤™

You may get in contact with the lead developer and owner by adding him on discord, his discord is McDonald's#0001, our plugins are not for sale and will never be open to the public market except the ones on this GitHub account which will be free.
